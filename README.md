- A Discord bot token ([How to create a bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html))
- Twitch API credentials (for stream notifications)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SanchoBlaze/blazeislebot.git
   cd BlazeIsleBot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `config/sample.json` to `config/default.json` and fill in your bot token and other required values.
4. **For Twitch integration:**
   - Get your Twitch Client ID and Secret from [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
   - Add them to your config file
5. (Optional) Deploy slash commands:
   ```bash
   node deploy-commands.js
   ```
6. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   node blazeislebot.js
   ```

### Command Management
- **Deploy global commands:** `npm run deploy:global` or `node deploy-commands.js global`
- **Deploy guild commands:** `npm run deploy:guild` or `node deploy-commands.js guild`
- **Remove global commands:** `npm run remove:global` or `node remove-commands.js global`
- **Remove guild commands:** `npm run remove:guild` or `node remove-commands.js guild`

**Note:** Global commands can take up to 1 hour to update across all servers, while guild commands update immediately.

## Configuration
- All configuration is handled in `config/default.json` (not tracked by git).
- Set your Discord bot token, rules channel/message IDs, Members role ID, and streams channel ID as described in the config file.
- **Twitch credentials:** Add your Twitch Client ID and Secret for stream notifications.

## Twitch Stream Notifications
Moderators and admins can manage Twitch stream notifications using the `/twitch` command:

- `/twitch add <username>` - Subscribe to a Twitch channel
- `/twitch remove <username>` - Unsubscribe from a Twitch channel  
- `/twitch list` - List all subscribed channels
- `/twitch status <username>` - Check a channel's current status

The bot checks for live streams every 5 minutes and posts notifications to the configured streams channel.

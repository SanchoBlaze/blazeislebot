# Blaze Isle Bot

A feature-rich Discord bot with modular architecture, economy system, loyalty tracking, Twitch integration, and more.

## Features
- **Modal-based configuration system** with intelligent validation
- **Automatic owner notifications** when configuration is needed
- **Crash-proof operation** with graceful fallbacks for missing settings
- Rules acceptance with ‚úÖ reaction to gain access
- **Configurable welcome messages** sent to designated channel
- **Advanced Twitch stream notifications** with real-time monitoring
- **Advanced loyalty/XP system** with scaled leveling and multi-level progression
- **üí∞ Comprehensive economy system** with wallet/bank, daily rewards, work, transfers, and shop
- **üåæ Advanced farming system** with crop variants, watering cans, fertilisers, and growth acceleration
- **Mythic rarity support**: Mythic items (üåà, magenta) are now available in the shop and inventory, with full support in all rarity tables and admin commands.
- **Crop variants**: Crops like peppers, tomatoes, and carrots have multiple variants (e.g., red/yellow/green), tracked in the database with a `variant` field and displayed with the correct emoji and name in inventory, harvest, and sell commands.
- **Watering cans**: All types (wood, copper, silver, gold, diamond, mythic) are available, each with increasing rarity and growth acceleration effect. Only the best can in your inventory is used for crop growth.
- **Fertilisers**: Six types of fertilisers (basic, premium, organic, magical, legendary, mythic) that increase crop yield with rarity-based success rates. Higher rarity crops have lower success rates, making fertilisers more effective on common crops.
- **Accurate staged growth system**: Crop growth times are now based on a staged system (e.g., common crops take 26 minutes, legendary 58 minutes, with each stage having a specific duration).
- **/farm info command**: Shows detailed information about each plot, including what is planted, stage, and time left to fully grow.
- **Sell confirmation**: When selling items (including via "Sell Quantity"), you now receive a confirmation message.
- **Buy Quantity**: The shop now features a "Buy Quantity" modal for bulk purchases, similar to the sell quantity functionality.
- **Command structure**: Farming commands are `/farm view` (interactive UI) and `/leaderboard farm` (top farmers). Removed references to `/farm plant` and `/farm harvest`.
- **Documentation**: See `FARMING_README.md` and `ECONOMY_README.md` for full details on farming, inventory, and item mechanics.
- **Engaging games**: Connect4, TicTacToe, RPS, RPSLS with XP rewards for winners
- **Animal commands**: Cute pictures with small XP rewards (cat, dog, fox, bunny, duck)
- **Social commands**: Hug and comfort other users for XP and community building
- **Utility commands**: 8ball, dadjoke, gif, server info, avatar, and help
- **Role-based permissions** for moderation commands
- Modular command structure for easy extension
- **Interactive paginator UI** for `/shop`, `/sell`, and `/use` commands: One item per page, navigation arrows, filter dropdown, action button, and emoji thumbnails for a modern, user-friendly experience.
- **Improved error handling and global interaction logic** for all interactive commands: No more failed interactions or double reply errors.
- **Scratch Card item**: A consumable with gambling logic‚Äîwin coins or a random item, with the reward's emoji shown as the embed thumbnail.
- **Profit margin logic for item pricing**: All shop items are priced so users always make a profit when using or selling them.
- **Admin command stability**: All admin commands now handle Discord interactions robustly, preventing double reply errors.
- **Weeds crop and mechanic**: Weeds can now grow on empty plots (5% chance per hour per plot). Weeds are a harvestable crop with their own emoji and are managed like other crops.
- **Emoji config requirement**: Whenever you add a new item to data/default-items.json, you must also add a corresponding entry to config/emoji-configs.json with the correct emoji (Unicode or custom).

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Add the Bot to Your Server
Click the link below to add Blaze Isle Bot to your Discord server:
**[Add Blaze Isle Bot to Discord](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=712264446827036672)**

After adding the bot, run `/config set` to configure the basic settings for your server. The bot will then be ready to use with all features enabled.

### Option 2: Run Your Own Instance
If you prefer to host your own instance of the bot, follow the installation and setup instructions below.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v22.16.0 or higher)
- npm
- A Discord bot token ([How to create a bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html))
- Twitch API credentials (for stream notifications)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SanchoBlaze/blazeislebot.git
   cd BlazeIsleBot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `config/sample.json` to `config/default.json` and fill in your bot token and other required values.
4. **For Twitch integration:**
   - Get your Twitch Client ID and Secret from [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
   - Add them to your config file
5. **Deploy slash commands** (see Command Management section below):
   ```bash
   # For testing (guild commands update immediately):
   npm run deploy:guild
   
   # For production (global commands take up to 1 hour):
   npm run deploy:global
   ```
6. Start the bot:
   To run the bot in a production environment, it is recommended to use PM2, a process manager for Node.js applications.
   ```bash
   # Install PM2 globally
   npm install -g pm2
   
   # Start the bot
   npm start
   
   # To view logs with timestamps
   pm2 logs BlazeIsleBot
   
   # To stop the bot
   npm stop
   ```

### Command Management
- **Deploy global commands:** `npm run deploy:global` or `node deploy-commands.js global`
- **Deploy guild commands:** `npm run deploy:guild` or `node deploy-commands.js guild`
- **Remove global commands:** `npm run remove:global` or `node remove-commands.js global`
- **Remove guild commands:** `npm run remove:guild` or `node remove-commands.js guild`

**Note:** Global commands can take up to 1 hour to update across all servers, while guild commands update immediately.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "This server is not configured for [feature]"
This message appears when trying to use a feature that requires configuration. **The server owner has automatically been notified** with setup instructions.

**Solution:** Run `/config set` and configure the required settings for that feature.

#### Features Not Working
If bot features aren't working as expected:

1. **Check configuration**: Run `/config view` to see current settings
2. **Verify permissions**: Ensure the bot has necessary permissions in configured channels
3. **Check channels/roles**: Make sure configured channels and roles still exist
4. **Owner notification**: If settings are missing, the owner will receive a DM with guidance

#### Bot Joined But No Welcome Message
This is normal! The bot sends setup instructions via **DM to the server owner** instead of posting in channels. Check your DMs for the welcome message with configuration instructions.

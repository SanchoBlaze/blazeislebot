## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v22.16.0 or higher)
- npm
- A Discord bot token ([How to create a bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html))
- Twitch API credentials (for stream notifications)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SanchoBlaze/blazeislebot.git
   cd BlazeIsleBot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `config/sample.json` to `config/default.json` and fill in your bot token and other required values.
4. **For Twitch integration:**
   - Get your Twitch Client ID and Secret from [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
   - Add them to your config file
5. **Deploy slash commands** (see Command Management section below):
   ```bash
   # For testing (guild commands update immediately):
   npm run deploy:guild
   
   # For production (global commands take up to 1 hour):
   npm run deploy:global
   ```
6. Start the bot:
   To run the bot in a production environment, it is recommended to use PM2, a process manager for Node.js applications.
   ```bash
   # Install PM2 globally
   npm install -g pm2
   
   # Start the bot
   npm start
   
   # To view logs with timestamps
   pm2 logs BlazeIsleBot
   
   # To stop the bot
   npm stop
   ```

### Command Management
- **Deploy global commands:** `npm run deploy:global` or `node deploy-commands.js global`
- **Deploy guild commands:** `npm run deploy:guild` or `node deploy-commands.js guild`
- **Remove global commands:** `npm run remove:global` or `node remove-commands.js global`
- **Remove guild commands:** `npm run remove:guild` or `node remove-commands.js guild`

**Note:** Global commands can take up to 1 hour to update across all servers, while guild commands update immediately.

## Guild Setup

### Easy Configuration with Modals
Once the bot is running and has been invited to a new server, an Administrator must configure it using the **new modal-based `/config` command**. This provides an intuitive interface for setting up all bot features.

#### Configuration Commands
- `/config view` - Displays the current settings for the server
- `/config set` - Opens an interactive interface with buttons for each setting

#### Interactive Setup Process
1. Run `/config set` to see all available configuration options
2. Click the button for the setting you want to configure
3. A modal will appear with clear instructions and input validation
4. Enter the channel name, role name, or ID - the bot accepts multiple formats:
   - **Channel IDs:** `123456789012345678`
   - **Channel names:** `general` or `#general`
   - **Role IDs:** `123456789012345678` 
   - **Role names:** `Moderator` or `@Moderator`

#### Required Settings
- **üìã Rules Channel**: The channel where your rules message is posted
- **üìù Rules Message ID**: The ID of the message that users must react to with ‚úÖ
- **üë• Members Role**: The role granted to users after they accept the rules

### Rules & Welcome System

### Loyalty/XP System

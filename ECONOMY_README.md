- **Growth Times**: Each crop has a base growth time (26-58 minutes) that can be reduced with watering cans
- **Harvesting**: Collect fully grown crops using the interactive `/farm` interface
- **Crop Variants**: Many crops have multiple variants (e.g., red, yellow, green peppers)

- **Database Storage**: Variants are stored with a `variant` field
- **Sell System**: Crops can be sold with rarity-based pricing
- **Weeds crop**: Weeds can grow on empty plots (5% chance per hour per plot) and are managed as a harvestable crop with their own emoji.
- **Emoji config requirement**: Whenever you add a new item to data/default-items.json, you must also add a corresponding entry to config/emoji-configs.json with the correct emoji (Unicode or custom).

### üé£ Fishing System

The fishing system allows players to catch fish and sell them for coins. The system features fishing rods for cooldown reduction and bait for rarity boosts, mirroring the farming system design.

#### Fishing Mechanics

- **Progressive Investment**: Higher-tier rods cost more but provide better cooldown reduction

#### How Bait Works
- **Consumable Items**: Bait is used up when applied and provides temporary effects
- **Success Rates**: Higher rarity bait has lower success rates for balance
- **Rare Fish Only**: Boost only applies to rare, epic, and legendary fish
- **Duration**: Bait effects last for 1 hour
